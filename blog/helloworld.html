        <h2>Well, where do I start?</h2>
        <p>I know its ugly, I will be working on that!</p>
        <p>I kinda made this website as a passion project, but I am starting to branch out, I made this entire website on 1/10/25, and I have no clue what I want to do with it as I go on... Oh well, I might post some personal shit as this blog continues, and hey! If I get better with my JavaScript I can add a commenting section for you guys to say shit on these pages, anyways thats it for now, just a simple Hello, World!</p>
